Thank you for participating in our Auteur user study. Please refer to the following steps to complete the study.

## Step 1

First, clone this repo locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/auteur-vis/auteur-study.git
```

Then install all necessary packages using `npm install`.

If all packages have been successfully installed, running `npm run storybook` should open a new browser window with 5 tabs. Each tab includes 7 visualizations. The tab labeled D3 includes the original visualization code given to participants, without augmentations. The tabs labeled P1-4 include Auteur augmentations added by study participants.
